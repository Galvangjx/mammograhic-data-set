### Mammograhpic Data Set Prediction

### Problem Statement:
Mammograhpy is an effective method in early detection of masses for breast cancer. With the low postitive prediction values of malignant case, patients are sent for further follow up of biopsy which are unnecesscary as results are often benign outcome. This stretches lab resources and incur unnecesscary cost onto patients.

This project aims to help doctors by complimenting their decision on whether or not a patient is truly required for biopsy. 3 BI-RADS attribute (Shape, Margin & Density) along with patients' Age and BI-RADS assessment results are used to build a cancer predictor program.
